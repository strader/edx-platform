    markdown: |
       A multiple choice problem presents radio buttons for student input. Students can only select a single option presented. Multiple Choice questions have been the subject of many areas of research due to the early invention and adoption of bubble sheets.
       
       One of the main elements that goes into a good multiple choice question is the existence of good distractors. That is, each of the alternate responses presented to the student should be the result of a plausible mistake that a student might make.

       Feedback can then be provided for each answer choice to address those mistakes.  The feedback is provided immediately below the question after the student clicks the "Check" button.  Hints can also be available for students to request when they are struggling.

            ||An important feature of the portable CD player was that it allowed consumers to take their music with them.||

       [explanation]
       The release of the iPod allowed consumers to carry their entire music library with them in a format that did not rely on fragile and energy-intensive spinning disks.
